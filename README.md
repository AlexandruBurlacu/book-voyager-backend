# BookVoyager Startup Backend Code Repository

During the summer of 2017 I was developing this code for the BookVoyager Startup where I was the technical co-founder.

Due to the fact that the project did not succeded, I decided to post the code online, as part of my portfolio.

It was running in production for more than half a year, without any issues, and was developed in under 2 months. It's not very fast tho.

Enjoy.
